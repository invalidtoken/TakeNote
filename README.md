# NoteApp

NoteApp is a notes taking application that stores all the notes in browser's LocalStorage. I build this app in my Modern Javascript Bootcamp course. The main purpose for building the application was to practice modern javascript features like ES6 Modules, ES6 classes, LocalStorageAPI, DOM Manipulation. 

The App uses Webpack to serve all the static files. I have also configured babel with webpack so that the app can be used in older browsers as well. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Your computer must have node.js and npm installed on it.
To install node.js you can look [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), node.js automatically installs npm so you don't have to worry about that but you can still look [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) for more information on npm. 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be
